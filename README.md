# Hi, I'm Joo.
[he/him]

I've been passionate about writing good (or interesting) code since 2017. React is my strength, but I also tend to try out anything that's hip and new. 

You can reach me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/joobacca/), [Instagram](https://www.instagram.com/joobacca2/) or the plain old [‚úâÔ∏è](mailto:kontakt@joohan.kim). 

Happy coding!
